I created a quiz that asks user questions. 

If user answer is wrong, then the timer decreases by 10 seconds. 

The quiz ends when user finishes to answer all questions or when time is done. 

I aks the user to input his username and store it, with its score, to local storage. 

I display the username and the score.
