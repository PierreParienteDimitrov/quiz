I created a quiz that asks user questions. When user starts the click, a timer starts. 

If user answer is wrong, then the timer decreases by 10 seconds. 

The quiz ends when user finishes to answer all questions or when time is done. 

I then ask the user to input his username. I store his score to local storage. 

I display the highest score from local storage on top of the page.
